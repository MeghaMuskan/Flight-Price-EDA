Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering on Flight Price Dataset using Python

# ✈️ Flight Price Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering on a flight price dataset to understand the key factors affecting airline ticket pricing.

## 📌 Objectives

* Analyze trends in flight ticket prices
* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* Engineer useful features from raw data
* Visualize important relationships affecting price

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

* Handling missing values
* Converting date/time features
* Feature engineering (duration, stops, journey time)
* Price distribution analysis
* Airline-wise price comparison
* Correlation and pattern visualization

## 📈 Outcome

The analysis revealed that airline type, total stops, journey duration, and travel time significantly impact flight ticket prices.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis using real-world datasets.
